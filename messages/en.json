      "paragraph1": "FiberLink was originally the engineering department of HKT, Hong Kong leading telecommunications provider. In June 2024, a significant milestone was reached when HKT indirect wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a sale and purchase agreement with investors, marking the beginning of FiberLink journey as an independent company.",
      "paragraph2": "The transaction, valued at US$870 million, represents a strategic move to unlock the value of HKT extensive passive network business by introducing long-term investment partners. This partnership enables the sharing of future capital expenditures related to expanding network infrastructure to support business growth.",
      "paragraph3": "As Hong Kong new residential developments are planned, enterprise digital transformation accelerates, and Greater Bay Area integration deepens, FiberLink will work alongside HKT and investors to expand its passive infrastructure business, supporting new service launches and expansion into new regions.",
      "paragraph4": "This strategic move allows HKT to strengthen its resources to enhance and broaden its consumer services, particularly in supporting digital lifestyle applications, while providing innovative and advanced technological solutions to enterprise customers."
